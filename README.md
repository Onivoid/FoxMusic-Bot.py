FoxMusic is a Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage") 3.5+, using the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library. It plays requested songs from YouTube and other services into a Discord server (or multiple servers). Besides, if the queue becomes empty FoxMusic will play through a list of existing songs with configuration. The bot features a permission system allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. As well as playing songs, FoxMusic is capable of streaming live media into a voice channel (experimental).
